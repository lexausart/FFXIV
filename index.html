    Life has many doors!

    <h2>Blaire Baines</h2>
    <p>
        A gambler never reveals her secrets.
    </p>

    <h2>Sanzang Sun</h2>
    <p>
        Sanzang was orphaned and raised in a monastery until her 17th birthday, where she made her wish to explore the
        world and spread her teachings.
        She's a bit clueless, though. It's usually up to others to teach her but she's always excited to learn and make
        friends on her journey.
